Samâ€™s Grandfather (a Farmer) became a Christian after a Missionary from the United States visited his home three generation ago.  From there a heritage of ministry was born in their family tree. Sam is the third generation in his family to serve the Lord as a Pastor. Sam was called to a position of leadership overseas within the Body of Christ when he moved to Canada in 2003.  He was the founder pastor of the Great Commission Church International in Toronto. He has now ministered in the church for more then 20 years overseas and in Canada.
                <br /><br />
                Sam has recently moved to Kitchener and is passionate about introducing university students and other people to Jesus Christ and seeing their lives transformed. On September 29, 2019 Sam and his wife Melissa planted The Great Commission Church in Kitchener.   They continue to work diligently towards the vision they believe God has put in their hearts.
